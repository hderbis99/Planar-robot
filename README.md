# Construction
My robot is made of four servos: 
  - SG90
  - 3 x FS5103B
  
This mechanism are powered from a battery cage, six battery 1,5[V]. Power goes into voltage stabilizers. This gives us 5[V] at the output and powers the servos. The circuit still has a joystick IDUINO which is connected to microcontoller Arduino, two systems PCF8574 which communicate on the magistarl I2C, piezzo/buzzer, four buttons, four switchs and four diodes.
